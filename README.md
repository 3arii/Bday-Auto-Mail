# Bday-Auto-Mail
This is an automatic birthday e-mail program I use frequently to send my friends birthday messages automatically in case I forget. (Which clearly happens pretty often)


Usage is pretty simple and forward.

1. Create a friend using the already created friends class.
2. Create a new if statement using the given preset for the new friend

Before setting it up you must declare the e-mail password and the e-mail itself which, you can do with environment variables for security and you should prioritize focusion on developing that habbit.

If you use Linux I assume you already know how to use environs.
